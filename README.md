# Student Residence Service

## About project
This project is about creating a REST API for the student residence service. 
![whole concept](images/main_idea.png)


## There are two main services
<ul>
    <li><i><b>Rental Service</b></i>: rent home appliances (vacuum, clothes iron, waffle
iron) and common space (e.g. for playing games or having a party)</li>
    <li><i><b>Bulletin Board Service</b></i>: be update to date with news announced by the
    administration and comment news</li>
</ul>

## Who are Web Clients?
### Resident
Resident can be any student who wants to use the service to make his/her life easier in case of renting house appliances which are provided by administration.
Also the student can be up to date with news from administration through this REST API.

### Administration
Administrator manages the rented house appliances. Also, Administrator can announce news to all students through this REST API.

### Caretaker
<p>Caretaker can get notification through this REST API to know about the broken appliances in the residence. The notification can be from students or administrator.</p>


## Use Cases
### Use Case 1
<p>Administrator can add home appliances with following criteria:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Home appliance information contains the serial number, model name, and type</li>
        <li>Types of home appliances are: Vacuum, Clothes Iron, Waffle Iron, Party Room, Table Room</li>
        <li>The API could show the number of available home appliances and the current state (broken/not broken)
        <li>The API should show the price for rental (â‚¬/day) and the maximum amount of time a home appliance can be rented</li>
    </ul>        
<p>The API should store the Home appliances in permanent database</p>
<p>The API should have proper response code such as <i>200</i> for successful creation of resource or <i>400</i> for the failed request</p>
<p>Each response should contain Hal-Links which indicate what can be done with resource for example GET</p>

### Use Case 2
<p>Resident or caretaker should be able to know which home appliances can be rented with such acceptance criteria:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>A set of home appliances can be found by model name</li>
        <li>
            A set of home appliances can be found by type
        </li> 
        <li>
            A set of home appliances can be found by status
        </li>
        <li>
            The response should contain all the information (price, days of rent, ..) of a rent beside its internal id
        </li>
        <li>
            The API should have proper response code accordingly such as <i>200</i> or </i>400</li>
        </li>
        <li>
            Each response should contain the Hal-Links which show what can be done with Resource such sa GET or POST

        </li>
        <li>
            The rent information should be saved in a database to be persistence
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            The server should have proper response code accordingly    
        </li>
        <li>
