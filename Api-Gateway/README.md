# Router and Filter: Zuul
Routing is an integral part of a microservice architecture. For example, / may be mapped to your web application, /api/users is mapped to the user service and /api/shop is mapped to the shop service. Zuul is a JVM-based router and server-side load balancer from Netflix.

Netflix uses Zuul for the following:
- Authentication
- Insights
- Stress Testing
- Canary Testing
- Dynamic Routing
- Service Migration
- Load Shedding
- Security
- Static Response handling
- Active/Active traffic management
